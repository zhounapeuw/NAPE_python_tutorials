    "The exercise modules are centered around analysis of neuroscience 2-photon imaging data, which involves recording __two-dimensional__ (X/Y space) changes in brightness of activity-dependent fluorescent proteins that are expressed in cells of interest. Typically the activity data stream consists of a 3-dimensional dataset (X, Y, and time; i.e. a video). For this particular dataset (acquired by Dr. Vijay Namboodiri), the data were collected through a GRIN lens of GCaMP6s-expressing neurons in orbitofrontal cortex. The data consists of single frames in the format of tifs, where each tif file is a sample collected across time.\n",

    "The exercises follow a sequence starting from identifying the list of files corresponding to each frame, filtering the list for particular frame numbers, loading the frames into numpy arrays, and visualizing the images. \n"
