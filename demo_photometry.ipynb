    "The exercise modules are centered around analysis of neuroscience fiber photometry data, which involves recording __bulk__ changes in brightness of activity-dependent fluorescent proteins that are expressed in cells of interest. Typically the activity data stream consists of a single vector time-series (i.e. fluorescence intensity measurements acquired across time). For this particular dataset (acquired by Dr. Adam Gordon-Fennell), animals were periodically allowed to consume liquid rewards in \"access periods.\" Both the onsets of the access periods and animal licks were recorded. The data consist of the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *_events.csv : table where rows contain the event type (access period or lick) and time of occurrence (in seconds)\n",
    "* *_streams_session.csv : table where rows are samples acquired across time for the photometry recording. For each sample, the table details the channel, time, and fluorescence value. __The data contain activity traces for a 405nm isosbestic control channel and a 465nm GCaMP signal.__\n",

    "The exercises follow a sequence starting from loading in (behavioral and neural stream) data from tabular files (excel CSVs), examining the data and extracting relevant data streams, preprocessing the data, and visualizing the activity.
