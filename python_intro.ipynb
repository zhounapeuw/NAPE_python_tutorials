    "\"Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.\" is what you get from the python website. But to a beginner, this is all mumbo-jumbo. Even for me, I have to look up what each phrase means. Let's break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interpreted: Python code is interpreted rather than compiled, meaning that another program (called the interpreter) converts the code to the language and set of commands that the computer processor can understand. The advantage here is that python is more user-friendly and the code you write doesn't need to be compiled to interact with the computer processors's native language.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Object-oriented: In addition to simple variables, arrays (multi-dimensional matrices), and lists (one-dimensional collection of ordered items) that can be declared in python, python also features objects. An object can be thought of as a code container that has specific variables and functions within; the advantage is that these variables/functions can be reused multiple times without affecting each instance. We will get further into this later.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* High-level: This concept is similar to the first feature: python language/syntax is abstracted from the \"machine code\" that the computer processor understands. This means that although there's a slight overhead in compute time, it is much easier to code in Python than say computer binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dynamic semantics: This means, in a simple example, that values can be assigned to variables without explicit declaration of the data type. This feature is not terribly important to beginner coders, but this is in contrast to Java and C where variables need to initialized first with information about data type (eg. int, float, etc.) Dynamic vs static semantics can be a very complicated topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More importantly for you, Python is useful because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's open source and highly customizable: the python community and userbase develops custom code for python that anyone can install on their computers. This allows you to mix and match different toolboxes/packages to suit your project's analytical needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's easier to use/learn basic python and typically requires less coding to perform tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It's object-oriented, which allows for modularization (ability to break code up into easier to understand, smaller components) and reduces redundancy of code.\n",

    "In contrast to writing your script in a python (.py) file, Jupyter notebooks contain cells that you write code into and can execute to display output immediately below the cell. You can have as many cells as you want and it's good practice to split your code into easy-to-understand chunks using the cells (to challenge yourself, try to keep each cell less than one or two dozen lines of code!). Accordingly, Jupyter notebook is a fantastic medium for writing and testing code. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Markdown__: As you probably noticed, there are cells that don't contain code, but rather comments (such as this one you are reading). These are called markdown cells and are useful for adding description or documentation; these execute and display their contents in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Some common Jupyter keyboard shortcuts:__\n",
    "\n",
    "Click within the cell : allows you to edit code within the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "Click in the white space margin left of the cell: selects the cell as a whole and allows you to execute keyboard shortcuts detailed below:\n",
