    "Functions are blocks of code that can be rerun and called (ie. executed) with a single statement. It's good practice to make sure functions serve a single purpose. `print()` is one such function where it takes in a single required argument in parens, typically a series of alphabets enclosed with quotes, and displays it as output. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Important__: Every instance when a function is called, the variables that are passed to the function and computed within the function are self-contained. This means that any variable created within the function is not accessible to code outside of it. This is a good feature of functions especially if you need to call multiple instances of the function and don't want variables in each instance to conflict with other instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can be arbitrarily named, can have any number of inputs, and any number of outputs. To write a basic function, it follows the schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "`def` _function_name_():  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _some computations_  \n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `return` _some_variable_\n",
    "\n",
    "where _function_name_ is an arbitrary name that describes what the function will do, _some computations_ are a few lines of code to perform some analyses, and _some_variable_ is a variable calculated within the body of the function that you want to return to the main code.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Importantly__, the syntax of writing a function must have `def` before the function name, and a colon at the end of the line. All following indented lines are a part of the function."
